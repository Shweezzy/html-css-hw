  <ol><h3>TAG</h3>
  <li>In information systems, a tag is a keyword or term assigned to a piece of information (such as an Internet bookmark, digital</li>
  <li>image, database record, or computer file). This kind of metadata helps describe an item and allows it to be found again by</li>
  <li>browsing or searching.<sup>[1]</sup> Tags are generally chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer,</li> 
  <li>depending on the system, although they may also be chosen from a controlled vocabulary.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
</ol>
  <ol><h3>ATTRIBUTE</h3>
  <li>HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a</li>
  <li>modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides</li>
  <li>functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an</li>
  <li>HTML start tag.</li>
</ol>
 
  <ol><h3>ELEMENT</h3>
  <li>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document or web page.[vague]</li>
  <li>HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node can have HTML attributes specified. Nodes can</li>
  <li>also have content, including other nodes and text. Many HTML nodes represent semantics, or meaning. For example,</li>
  <li>the &lt;title&gt; node represents the title of the document.</li>
  </ol>
